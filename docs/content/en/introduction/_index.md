When "high concurrency and low latency" become standard requirements for modern applications, traditional WAFs put developers in a dilemma: security or speed? We believe you can have both. WGE's goal is crystal clear: achieve extreme performance while maintaining full compatibility with the globally adopted OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS). Through excellent architecture design and optimized processing workflows, WGE maximizes request processing speed while ensuring security, meeting modern applications' demands for high concurrency and low latency.

First, we would like to thank the [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) project, which provided a solid foundation for WGE's SecLang++. SecLang is a domain-specific language (DSL) developed by ModSecurity for defining web application protection rules.

SecLang++ is an extension of SecLang, adding many new features and improvements to meet the needs of modern web application protection.

In this chapter, in addition to introducing the basic syntax and usage of SecLang, we will focus on the new features and capabilities added in SecLang++.
